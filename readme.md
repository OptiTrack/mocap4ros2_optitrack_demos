# MOCAP4ROS2_Optitrack demos

This repo contains a collection of two demos for using Optitrack with ROS2.

See [robot_arm_follower_demo instructions](robot_arm_follower_demo/instructions.md) for a demo of a robot arm following a rigid body.

See [rover_steering_demo instructions](rover_steering_control_demo/instructions.md) for a demo of an AGV moving and steering controlled by a moving rigid body.

See [mocap4ros2-setup](https://docs.optitrack.com/robotics/mocap4ros2-setup) for an overview of the project on our site!

This demo contains code from a third party [mocap4ros2_optitrack](https://github.com/MOCAP4ROS2-Project/mocap4ros2_optitrack) which contains the original driver code using NatNet.

You can find more information about using OptiTrack for robotics on the [officeial OptiTrack documentation](https://docs.optitrack.com/robotics). 

Feel free to submit issues or feature requests!
