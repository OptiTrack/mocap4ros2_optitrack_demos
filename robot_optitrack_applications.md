# Robot Optitrack Applications

The following items are some example possible applications that can be achived with an OptiTrack system robots (typically using ROS2):

1. Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGV)
    - Warehouse control system to monitor AGV position for moving packages or people around a large space.
    - Research in an academic setting, [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0LIU1Sf6p0). 
    - Developing new products like package delivery robots.
    - Evaluating the efficiency of devices like cleaning robots.
2. Drone Tracking
    - Entertainment or art projects such as tracking drones in a stadium or making patterns in the sky at night.
    - Ensuring repeatable path for film or comercials, [example1](https://www.optitrack.com/about/customers/kmelRobotics.html) [example2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Cin3sqPRj4).
    - Monitoring or data collection for analysis, [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA0imIaL_F0).
    - Research in an adademic setting, [example](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/a-drone-that-gets-around-obstacles-like-an-insec-2/).
3. Robotic Arms
    - Moving the arm in a confined space accurately for applications like food preparation.
    - Developing a new arm and validating positional locations.
    - Use in assembly lines to assure quality product.
    - Object dectection and avoidance.
4. Other
    - Mounting a robot arm on an AGV to automate data collection for SLAM algorithms.
    - Drift correction for robots traveling over a large space.
    - Research into new types of robotic devices, [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFmeHPVtK0o).
    - Other cool projects that use robotics to solve fun problems, [example1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MkrNVic7pw) [example2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHWXZyfhQas)

Optitrack cameras are particular good for any application involving a robot that needs highly accurate positional data at low latencies and high frame rates.
